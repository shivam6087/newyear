        <p style="  font-weight: bold;">Dear My Love shreya ‚ù§Ô∏è,</p>
        <p>
          my love! üéâ As we approach a new beginning, 
          I want you to know how incredibly special you are to me. From our first online meeting on 04/08/2023 to the unforgettable
           day we met in person on 05/12/2023, you've brought so much joy and love into my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being in a long-distance relationship isn't always easy, but your cuteness and love make every moment worth it.
           Meeting you in person was a dream come true, and it made me realize how much you mean to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we step into the new year, my only wish is to create more beautiful memories together. No matter what comes our way, I'm here for you. 
          Wishing you a year filled with love, happiness, and unforgettable moments.
        </p>
        <p>You're my greatest joy, and I'm grateful for every second with you.</p>
